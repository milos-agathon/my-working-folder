# Solution code for 2 SQL interview challenges (1 medium + 1 hard)

This SQL repo helps you solve 2 interview questions (medium and hard difficulty) from stratascratch. Each file creates a table using data from the respective task and runs a query to solve the challenge. Note that the solutions to these two challenges are not available at stratascratch.com unless you have a premium membership (which I don't).
