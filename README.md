# Solution code for 2 SQL interview challenges (1 medium + 1 hard)

This SQL repo helps you solve 2 interview questions (medium and hard difficulty) from stratascratch. 

1) The medium challenge asks you to write a query that identifies cities with higher than average home prices when compared to the national average and show the city names.

2) The hard challenge requires you to find the email activity rank for each user where email activity rank is the total number of emails sent while returning unique rankings even if multiple users have the same number of emails.

Each file creates a table using data from the respective task and runs a query to solve the challenge. Note that the solutions to these two challenges are not available at stratascratch.com unless you have a premium membership (which I don't).
